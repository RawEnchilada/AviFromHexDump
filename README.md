A cmd tool to find and export avi files from hex source

This is in no way a perfect tool, usually you will find tearings in your videos, especially if they have overwritten previous avi-s.

Usage: 
- "Videos" folder needs to exist beside the exe.\n  
- Put your file beside the exe.\n  
- Start the exe.\n
- Type in your file's name, Ex.: Hex.txt
- Type in the maximum bytes of the file or type "default" if you're uncertain.
  *default size is set for a file around 30gb*
- Choose between little[1] or big[0] endian, usually it's little.
- Wait for the program to finish.
